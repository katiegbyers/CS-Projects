    "In Project 2 Part A, you made an effort to understand the data through EDA, and did some basic feature engineering. You also built a Logistic Regression model to classify Spam/Ham emails. In Part B, you will learn how to evaluate the classifiers you built. You will also have the chance to improve your model by selecting more features.\n",

If you encounter these examples and believe it is inappropriate for students, please let a TA know and we will try to remove it for future semesters. Thanks for your understanding!\n",

In order to get full credit on the accuracy part of this assignment, you must get at least **88%** accuracy on the test set.

    "    1. Use of punctuation (e.g., how many '!' were there?)\n",

    "    1. Whether the email is a reply to an earlier email or a forwarded email\n",
    "1. Finding better (and/or more) words to use as features. Which words are the best at distinguishing emails? This requires digging into the email text itself. \n",
    "1. Better data processing. For example, many emails contain HTML as well as text. You can consider extracting out the text from the HTML to help you find better words. Or, you can match HTML tags themselves, or even some combination of the two.\n",
    "1. Model selection. You can adjust parameters of your model (e.g. the regularization parameter) to achieve higher accuracy. Recall that you should use cross-validation to do feature and model selection properly! Otherwise, you will likely overfit to your training data.\n",

I also took into account the total body length of the email itself and whether or not the email is a reply and contains the string 'Re:' in the subject line. Finally, my last set of features were garnered by researching the most common words in english called stop-words and running the words_in_texts method on them to generate a set of features.\n",

    "\n",
    "The following code will write your predictions on the test dataset to a CSV, which you can submit to Kaggle. You may need to modify it to suit your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Save your predictions in a 1-dimensional array called `test_predictions`. *Even if you are not submitting to Kaggle, please make sure you've saved your predictions to `test_predictions` as this is how your score for this question will be determined.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that if you've performed transformations or featurization on the training data, you must also perform the same transformations on the test data in order to make predictions. For example, if you've created features for the words \"drug\" and \"money\" on the training data, you must also extract the same features in order to use scikit-learn's `.predict(...)` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should submit your CSV files to https://www.kaggle.com/t/c76d80f7d3204159865a324ec2936f18\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: You may submit up to 4 times a day. If you have submitted 4 times on a day, you will need to wait until the next day for more submissions.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this question is graded on an absolute scale based on the accuracy your model achieves on the test set and the score does not depend on your ranking on Kaggle. \n",
    "\n",
    "*The provided tests check that your predictions are in the correct format, but you must submit to Kaggle to evaluate your classifier accuracy.*\n",
